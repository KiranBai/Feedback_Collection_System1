During my internship at HeadStarter AI Hackathon with in 7 Hired Companies, I undertook the development of a Feedback Collection System, a project that aimed to streamline the process of gathering and analyzing user feedback. This system was designed to be both user-friendly and efficient, allowing users to submit feedback seamlessly, while providing administrators with powerful tools to categorize and analyze the responses.

The system's intuitive interface ensures that feedback can be easily submitted by users, whether they are clients, customers, or employees. On the backend, the system categorizes this feedback, enabling administrators to generate detailed reports that highlight user satisfaction levels and pinpoint areas needing improvement. This project not only honed my skills in both frontend and backend development but also deepened my understanding of creating applications that balance functionality with ease of use.

The Feedback Collection System reflects my commitment to building tools that drive continuous improvement through user insights. You can view the full report on this project here Feedback_Collection_System Report:
